        <h1>Privacy Policy for Mood Mirror</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 22, 2024</p>
        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Mood Mirror, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
        
        <h2>Your Photos Stay Yours</h2>
        <p>
            We are committed to your privacy. All photo processing, meme creation, and emoji placement happens directly in your browser on your device. <strong>Your images are never uploaded to our servers.</strong> They remain on your computer or mobile device unless you choose to download or share the final meme.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> Like most website operators, Mood Mirror may collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use the website.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> A cookie is a small file that a website stores on a visitorâ€™s computer. We use cookies to manage your consent for personalized advertising and to help us identify and track visitors' usage of the site. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advertising and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
            We use third-party advertising companies, like Google AdSense, to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our cookie consent banner allows you to control whether personalized ads are shown. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ad & Content Network privacy policy</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
